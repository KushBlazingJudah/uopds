# uopds

uopds is a work-in-progress OPDS server implementing nothing more than the bare
minimum required to interface with Koreader.

The feature scope is literally nothing more than listing out books in a
directory and making them available to download.

## Supported features

As mentioned, this list is kept intentionally sparse.

- generates an OPDS catalog for files in a directory
- supports EPUBs and nothing else (yet)
- most likely doesn't implement the specs correctly

## Running

Clone and `go run`.
Configuration coming soon.
